<h1>Football In Ireland</h1>
<p>The League of Ireland together with the Football Association of Ireland, is one of the two main governing bodies responsible for organising association football in the Republic of Ireland.
 The term was originally used to refer to a single division league. 
 However today the League of Ireland features five divisions â€“ the Premier Division, the First Division, an U19 Division, an U17 Division and an U15 Division.
 The League of Ireland has always worked closely with the FAI and in 2006 the two bodies formally merged.</p>
