<H2>Rugby in Ireland</h2>
<p>The Sport of Rugby you can say bring irleand closer togtehr as A nation, unlike Football Rugby in Ireland is not split up, 
we dont have a Republic of Ireland Team and A Northan Ireland Team It has a team with players coming from all 32 counties of Ireland.
</p>
<p>Irish Rugby is one nation and because of this they needed to come up with a second anthem for the entier nation to sing as a whole. 
coming up with a second song was probably better than having The queens song rang out at every Game.
to solve this the IRFU Had a new song wrote that every one can sing, it was called Irelands Call</p>
<h1>Irelands Call</h1>
<p>"Come the day and come the hour
Come the power and the glory
We have come to answer
Our Country's call
From the four proud provinces of Ireland"</p>
<p>Â 
"Ireland, Ireland
Together standing tall
Shoulder to shoulder
We'll answer Ireland's call"</p>
 
 <h2>Possition</h2>
